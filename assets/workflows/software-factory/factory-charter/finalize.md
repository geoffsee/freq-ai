## Instructions

Incorporate feedback and produce the FINAL Factory Charter.

1. Finalize mission, scope, and non-negotiable safety constraints.
2. Finalize the autonomous execution contract for GitHub Actions runs.
3. Create or update one open GitHub issue labeled `strategic-review` titled
   "Software Factory Charter" containing:
   - the final charter
   - the non-negotiable safety checklist
   - readiness gaps and remediation plan
4. Update STATUS.md with a short "Software Factory Charter" section.
5. Update ISSUES.md with a "Software Factory Setup Backlog" section listing
   actionable next steps.
6. Ensure ISSUES.md and the strategic-review issue are in parity.

Operate directly with `gh` commands when writing or updating the issue.
