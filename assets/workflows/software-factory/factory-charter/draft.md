## Instructions

Produce a DRAFT "Factory Charter" that enables safe autonomous evolution through GitHub Actions.

1. Define the mission and operating scope for the virtual software factory.
2. Define hard guardrails:
   - required test/lint/security checks before merge
   - branch protection expectations
   - policy for dependency and migration changes
   - rollback and incident response expectations
3. Define execution contracts for autonomous runs:
   - where work is sourced from (issues, tracker, labels)
   - how dependencies and blockers are represented
   - how the agent should behave when context is ambiguous
4. Define required repository context artifacts (STATUS.md, ISSUES.md, AGENTS.md, labels).
5. Define measurable autonomy KPIs (lead time, pass rate, rollback rate, stale work).
6. Output:
   - a concise charter
   - a "Non-Negotiable Safety Rules" checklist
   - a "Factory Readiness Gaps" list with concrete remediation actions

This is a DRAFT for human review. Do NOT modify files or create GitHub issues in this phase.
