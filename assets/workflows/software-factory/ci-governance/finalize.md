## Instructions

Incorporate feedback and produce the FINAL CI governance hardening plan.

1. Convert approved findings into actionable GitHub issues with acceptance criteria.
2. Create or update a tracker issue labeled `tracker,security` titled
   "CI Governance Hardening" that captures:
   - prioritized remediation backlog
   - dependency ordering
   - completion criteria
   - parser-compatible checklist of child issues using `- [ ] #N Title (blocked by #X)` rows
3. Do not add the `tracker` label to child issues. Add `Tracked by #<tracker>` to each child issue body.
4. Update ISSUES.md with the same remediation plan and dependency structure.
5. Update STATUS.md with key governance risks and mitigation status.
6. Ensure issue tracker and local docs remain in parity.

Use `gh issue create` / `gh issue edit` for GitHub updates.
