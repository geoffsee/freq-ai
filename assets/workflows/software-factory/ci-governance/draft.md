## Instructions

Produce a DRAFT CI governance audit focused on safe autonomous operation via GitHub Actions.

1. Audit workflow safety controls:
   - least-privilege token scopes
   - protected branch requirements
   - mandatory checks and required reviewers (where applicable)
   - concurrency/cancel-in-progress behavior
2. Identify failure amplification risks:
   - loops that can self-trigger endlessly
   - merges without sufficient validation
   - flaky or non-deterministic verification gates
3. Identify missing observability:
   - run-level traceability to issue/PR/tracker
   - post-failure diagnostics and artifacts
4. Output:
   - findings grouped by severity
   - concrete remediation actions
   - a prioritized hardening roadmap for CI

This is a DRAFT for human review. Do not modify workflow files or open issues in this phase.
