## Instructions

Produce a DRAFT autonomous backlog designed for execution by GitHub Actions.

1. Start from the Factory Charter and identify priority work streams.
2. Build a dependency-aware task hierarchy with clear layering for parallel execution.
3. Separate work into:
   - Platform hardening (CI, security, reproducibility)
   - Product evolution (features, quality, performance)
   - Operability (observability, rollback, docs hygiene)
   Keep any item requiring changes under `.github/`, especially `.github/workflows/**`,
   out of the proposed executable tracker. List those as manual control-plane follow-up.
4. For each candidate item, provide:
   - outcome-oriented title
   - acceptance criteria
   - risk level
   - required checks before merge
5. Output:
   - a dependency table
   - a proposed tracker checklist
   - a "ready now" subset for the next autonomous iteration

This is a DRAFT for human review. Do NOT create or edit GitHub issues in this phase.
