## Instructions

Produce a DRAFT execution plan for the next autonomous sprint run on GitHub Actions.

1. Identify the active tracker and all unblocked child issues.
2. Build an execution sequence that maximizes safe parallelism by dependency layer.
3. For each layer, define:
   - expected deliverables
   - validation gates (tests, lint, security, smoke checks)
   - stop conditions and rollback triggers
4. Propose GitHub Actions orchestration guidance:
   - workflow trigger strategy
   - concurrency and cancellation policy
   - required status checks before merge
5. Output:
   - layer-by-layer implementation plan
   - merge gate checklist
   - escalation protocol when an agent run fails repeatedly

This is a DRAFT for human review. Do not mutate GitHub issues or files in this phase.
