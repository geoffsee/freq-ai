## Instructions

Produce a DRAFT retrospective for the latest autonomous factory cycle.

1. Summarize what shipped, what stalled, and what regressed.
2. Evaluate autonomy health:
   - CI pass/fail reliability
   - cycle throughput
   - rework and rollback signals
   - blocker discovery latency
3. Identify root causes for misses and recurring failure patterns.
4. Propose concrete process, policy, and tooling improvements for the next cycle.
5. Output:
   - "Went well / Went poorly / Action items"
   - top 3 systemic risks
   - prioritized next-cycle experiments

This is a DRAFT for human review. Do not create issues or modify files in this phase.
