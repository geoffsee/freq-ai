## Instructions

Incorporate feedback and publish the FINAL retrospective.

1. Finalize cycle outcomes, root causes, and targeted improvements.
2. Create or update one open issue labeled `retrospective` titled
   "Software Factory Retrospective" with final conclusions and action items.
   Use only the `retrospective` label. Do not add `tracker`; this issue is an artifact, not an executable tracker.
3. Create follow-up issues for approved improvement actions and link them from the retrospective issue.
   Do not add `tracker` to follow-up issues unless a separate parent tracker is also created with a parser-compatible child checklist.
4. Update STATUS.md with retrospective outcomes and next-cycle focus.
5. Update ISSUES.md with follow-up actions and dependency notes.
6. Keep GitHub issues and local docs in parity.

Use `gh issue create` and `gh issue edit` for issue management.
