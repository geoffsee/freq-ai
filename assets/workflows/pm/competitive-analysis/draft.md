## Instructions

Produce a comprehensive competitive analysis with these sections:

### 1. Market Overview
- Define the market category and boundaries for {{project_name}}.
- Identify the primary user segments and their buying criteria.
- Note any recent market shifts, consolidation, or emerging trends that affect
  the competitive landscape.
- Estimate the market maturity: nascent, growing, mature, or declining.

### 2. Competitor Profiles (3-5 competitors)
For each competitor, provide:
- **Name & positioning** — How they describe themselves, who they target.
- **Key strengths** — What they do better than {{project_name}} today.
- **Key weaknesses** — Where they fall short or have known pain points.
- **Recent moves** — Notable launches, pivots, funding, or partnerships in the
  last 6 months.
- **Threat level** — High / Medium / Low, with one-line rationale.

### 3. Feature Comparison Matrix
Create a comparison table across key capability dimensions:

| Capability | {{project_name}} | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| ...        | ...               | ...         | ...         | ...         |

Rate each as: Strong, Adequate, Weak, or Missing.

### 4. Positioning Analysis
- Where does {{project_name}} sit on the value/complexity spectrum?
- What is the current differentiation — is it defensible?
- Are there positioning gaps (capabilities we have but don't communicate)?
- What positioning would resonate most with our target users?

### 5. Strategic Implications
- **Opportunities** — Where can {{project_name}} gain ground? What competitor
  weaknesses can we exploit?
- **Threats** — Where are competitors gaining momentum? What could erode our position?
- **Recommended focus areas** — 3-5 concrete areas where competitive pressure
  should inform the roadmap, with rationale.

## Format

Keep the analysis factual and evidence-based. Reference specific features, capabilities,
and observable market signals. Where information is inferred rather than observed, flag
it explicitly.

This is a DRAFT for human review. Do NOT create or edit any GitHub issues yet.
The human will validate the competitor list, correct mischaracterizations, add insider
knowledge, and adjust the strategic implications. Present the output clearly so they can
give targeted feedback.
