{{#if strategic_review}}
## Strategic Review Recommendation (from GitHub issue labelled `strategic-review`)

{{strategic_review}}

The feature brief issue body MUST include `Depends On #<strategic-review-number>` so it
links back to the strategic review.

---
{{/if}}
## Human Feedback

The human reviewed the draft feature brief and provided this feedback:

{{feedback}}

## Instructions

Incorporate the feedback above. Adjust requirements, scope, user stories, and success
metrics as directed. Resolve any open questions the human answered. Add any business
context or constraints they provided.

Then produce the FINAL feature brief with these sections:

1. **Problem Statement** — Updated to reflect feedback.
2. **User Stories** — Adjusted priorities and coverage.
3. **Requirements** — Functional and non-functional, corrected per feedback.
4. **Success Metrics** — Refined targets and measurement methods.
5. **Scope & Constraints** — Updated in/out of scope.
6. **Open Questions** — Updated (resolved questions moved to relevant sections).

## Publishing the Feature Brief as a GitHub Issue

After completing the final brief, publish it as a GitHub issue so it is reviewable,
durable, and consumable by downstream workflows (Sprint Planning, Engineering).
{{#if dry_run}}

**DRY RUN MODE**: Do NOT actually run any `gh` commands. Instead, print the exact commands you WOULD run (gh issue list, gh issue edit/create) with their full arguments, so the human can review what would be filed.
{{/if}}

1. **Find or create the feature brief issue.** Run
   `gh issue list --state open --label "feature-brief" --json number,title --limit 5`
   to see if an open feature-brief issue already exists for this feature.
   - If one exists that covers the same feature, **edit it in place** with
     `gh issue edit <number> --body-file -` (or `--title` if the headline changed).
     Reuse the same issue so the brief remains a single living document.
   - If none exists for this feature, create one with
     `gh issue create --title "Feature Brief: <YYYY-MM-DD> — <feature headline>" --label "feature-brief"`.
     Use only the `feature-brief` label — do NOT add `tracker` or any sprint/area
     labels, since this issue is a specification artifact, not schedulable work.

2. **Body structure.** The single issue body MUST contain, in order:
   - **Problem Statement** — The user/business problem being solved.
   - **User Stories** — Prioritised user stories.
   - **Functional Requirements** — Specific behaviors.
   - **Non-functional Requirements** — Performance, security, scalability.
   - **Success Metrics** — Measurable outcomes with targets.
   - **Scope & Constraints** — In scope, out of scope, constraints, assumptions.
   - **Open Questions** — Remaining items needing resolution.
   - **Dependencies** — `Depends On #<strategic-review-number>` linking back to the
     Strategic Review issue this brief was built from (if one exists).
   - **Last Updated** — today's date.

3. **Do not file per-requirement issues, do not file a parent tracker issue, do not edit
   any other GitHub issue.** The output of this workflow is exactly one issue artifact.
   Sprint planning will decompose the brief into trackable sprint issues at that stage.

4. **Update ISSUES.md** — Reference the feature brief issue.
5. **Update STATUS.md** — If the brief introduces a new capability to track, add or
   update the relevant rows.
6. CRITICAL: ISSUES.md and GitHub issues must remain in parity. Update them NOW.

After publishing, print the issue URL. Format: `Feature brief published: <URL>`
