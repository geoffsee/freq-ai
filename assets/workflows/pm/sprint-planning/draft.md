## Instructions

Produce a DRAFT sprint plan for the next development cycle:

0. **Read upstream recommendations.** The Strategic Review workflow publishes a single
   living issue labelled `strategic-review` whose body contains the **Recommended Path
   Forward** — the canonical list of candidate work items for sprint planning. Run
   `gh issue list --state open --label strategic-review --json number,title --limit 5` to
   find it, then `gh issue view <number>` to read its body. Treat the items in
   "Recommended Path Forward" as the primary input pool for this sprint plan; the open
   issues list below is supplementary context (in-flight work, leftover items, PRs).
1. **Analyse** — Review the strategic-review recommendations, open issues, open PRs, and
   completed work. Identify what is ready, what is blocked, and what has open review work.
   Evaluate each candidate through a PM lens: what user value does it deliver? What
   business outcome does it advance?
2. **Prioritise** — Rank work items by user impact and business urgency. Consider
   dependencies. Favor items that deliver visible user value over pure infrastructure work
   unless infrastructure is blocking user-facing delivery.
3. **Dependencies** — Identify dependencies between work items. Assign each item a Layer
   number (0 = no dependencies, 1 = depends on layer-0 items, etc.). Items in the same
   layer can run in parallel.
4. **Group** — Organise items into a coherent sprint with clear goals framed as user
   or business outcomes ("Users can do X" not "Implement Y").
5. **Estimate** — Provide rough sizing (S/M/L) for each item.
6. **Output** — Present the draft sprint plan with a Task Dependency Hierarchy table:

   | Issue | Depends On | Depended On By | Layer | Status |
   |-------|-----------|----------------|-------|--------|

   followed by a Markdown checklist with `- [ ] #N Title (blocked by #X, #Y)` entries.

If there are open PRs that should be merged before new work begins, call that out.

This is a DRAFT for human review. Do NOT create or modify any GitHub issues.
The human will provide feedback before the plan is finalised.
