## Roadmap Output

Produce a structured roadmap that includes:

1. **Strategic Intent** — A brief (1-2 paragraph) product vision statement for the next
   several months. Focus on user outcomes and business goals, not technical milestones.
2. **Milestone Phases** — For each of the three phases defined above, provide:
   - Goals & Outcomes (framed as user or business outcomes)
   - 3-5 high-level initiatives (as a bulleted list — these are NOT separate GitHub issues,
     they are sections of the single roadmap document)
   - Success metrics (measurable indicators of phase completion)
   - Key dependencies and risks

The finalized roadmap will be published as **exactly one** GitHub issue carrying the
`roadmap` label — a single common operating picture for management forecasting. Do not
propose a parent-tracker / child-issue layout; phases and initiatives live inside the
body of that one issue, not as separate trackable work items.

This is a DRAFT for human review. Do NOT create or edit any GitHub issues yet.
The human will review the roadmap, adjust timelines, and refine initiatives.
Present the output clearly so they can give targeted feedback.
