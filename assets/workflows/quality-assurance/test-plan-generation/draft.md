## Instructions

Produce a comprehensive test plan with these sections:

### 1. Test Objectives & Scope
- What are the primary goals of testing for this feature/change?
- What is **in scope** for testing (functional, integration, performance, security)?
- What is **out of scope** (legacy components, third-party integrations not affected)?

### 2. Test Strategy
- Describe the overall approach (e.g., manual vs. automated, black-box vs. white-box).
- Identify the levels of testing required (unit, integration, E2E, UAT).
- Specify the test environment and data requirements.

### 3. Test Cases & Scenarios
Outline 10-15 key test scenarios, including:
- **Positive Scenarios**: Typical user flows and expected behaviors.
- **Negative Scenarios**: Invalid inputs, error conditions, and boundary cases.
- **Edge Cases**: Rare but critical paths or unusual data combinations.
- For each scenario, define:
  - Description and objective.
  - Pre-conditions.
  - Steps to execute.
  - Expected results.
  - Priority (High, Medium, Low).

### 4. Regression Testing
- Identify existing features or components that might be affected.
- List the most critical regression tests to run to ensure no breakage.

### 5. Performance & Security Considerations
- Define performance benchmarks (latency, throughput, resource usage) if applicable.
- Identify potential security risks (data leaks, unauthorized access) and how to test for them.

### 6. Tools & Infrastructure
- List the tools, frameworks, and libraries required for testing (e.g., `cargo test`, `nextest`, custom scripts).
- Note any specific hardware or cloud resources needed.

## Format

Keep the test plan structured and actionable. Use clear headings and tables/lists for test cases. Reference specific system components and issues where relevant.

This is a DRAFT for human review. The human will provide feedback, adjust test priorities, and suggest additional scenarios.
