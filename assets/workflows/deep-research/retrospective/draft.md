## Conduct the retrospective:

### 1. What shipped
- Summarise the features, fixes, and improvements that landed.
- Were the sprint goals met? What was left incomplete and why?

### 2. What went well
- Which patterns, tools, or approaches produced good results?
- Were there any wins worth repeating (clean merges, good test coverage, fast turnarounds)?

### 3. What was painful
- Where did the process break down? Flaky tests, merge conflicts, unclear requirements?
- Were there bottlenecks — blocked issues, stale PRs, missing context?
- Did any implemented work need immediate follow-up fixes?

### 4. What to change
- Concrete process improvements for the next cycle.
- Are there recurring problems that need a systemic fix (tooling, documentation, conventions)?
- Should the sprint size, scope, or structure change?

### 5. Velocity & health
- Rough throughput: how many issues closed vs. opened?
- Is the open issue/PR backlog growing, shrinking, or stable?
- Any signs of tech debt accumulating faster than it's being addressed?

## Output

Produce a structured retrospective report with the five sections above.

The finalized retrospective will be published as **exactly one** GitHub issue carrying
the `retrospective` label — a single living retrospective artifact for this cycle. Do
not propose a one-issue-per-action-item layout; action items live as a checklist inside
the body of that one issue, not as separate trackable work items, so the retro does not
percolate into sprint planning as discrete tickets.

This is a DRAFT for human review. Do NOT create or edit any GitHub issues yet.
The human will add their own observations, correct misreadings, and highlight what matters most.
