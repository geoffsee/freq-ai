## Human Feedback on the Draft

The human reviewed the draft sprint plan and provided this feedback:

{{feedback}}

## Instructions

Incorporate the feedback above and produce the FINAL sprint plan:

0. **Re-read upstream recommendations.** Sprint planning's primary input pool is the
   single open `strategic-review` issue's **Recommended Path Forward** section. Fetch it
   with `gh issue list --state open --label strategic-review --json number --limit 5`
   followed by `gh issue view <number>`. Pick from those recommendations; treat the open
   issues list above as supplementary context for in-flight work.
1. Adjust priorities, grouping, and scope based on the feedback.
2. Create GitHub issues for each work item using `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`.
   Do NOT include `Tracked by #<tracker>` yet — the tracker doesn't exist until step 3.
   The back-reference will be added by `gh issue edit` in step 4.
   **Ordering**: create all child issues first, collect their `#N` numbers, then create the tracker.
3. Create a GitHub tracker issue using:
   `gh issue create --title "Sprint: <goal>" --body "..." --label "sprint,tracker"`
   The tracker body must contain:
   - A Task Dependency Hierarchy table:

     | Issue | Depends On | Depended On By | Layer | Status |
     |-------|-----------|----------------|-------|--------|
     | #N Title | #X | #Y | 0 | 🔴 Not Started |

   - A checklist with `- [ ] #N Title (blocked by #X, #Y)` entries for each item.
4. Edit each child issue to add `Tracked by #<tracker>` in the body using
   `gh issue edit <child> --body "..."`.
5. Update ISSUES.md to add the new sprint's Task Dependency Hierarchy section. Keep existing completed sections intact.
6. Update STATUS.md if the sprint scope changes the status of any tracked feature.
7. CRITICAL: ISSUES.md and GitHub issues must remain in parity. Update them NOW.
