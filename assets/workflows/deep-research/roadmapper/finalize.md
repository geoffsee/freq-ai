## Final Roadmap Execution

Your final task is to publish the roadmap as **exactly one** GitHub issue — a single
"common operating picture" for management forecasting. Do NOT create child or initiative
issues; phases and initiatives belong as sections inside this single issue's body, not as
separate trackable work items. Sprint planning consumes its own workflow; the roadmap must
not percolate into sprint planning as discrete tickets.

1. **Find or create the roadmap issue.** Run
   `gh issue list --state open --label "roadmap" --json number,title --limit 5`
   to see if an open roadmap issue already exists.
   - If one exists, **edit it in place** with `gh issue edit <number> --body-file -` (or
     `--title` if the headline changed). Reuse the same issue so the roadmap remains a
     single living document.
   - If none exists, create one with
     `gh issue create --title "Roadmap: <YYYY-MM-DD> — <headline>" --label "roadmap"`.
     Use only the `roadmap` label — do NOT add `tracker` or any sprint/area
     labels, since this issue is a strategic artifact, not schedulable work.

2. **Body structure.** The single issue body MUST contain, in order:
   - **Strategic Intent** — 1-2 paragraph vision statement.
   - **Phase 1: Foundation**, **Phase 2: Expansion**, **Phase 3: Ecosystem** — each with
     Goals & Outcomes, the 3-5 initiatives as a bulleted list (NOT as `#N` issue refs),
     and Success Metrics.
   - **Dependencies** — `Depends On #<strategic-review-number>` linking back to the
     Strategic Review issue this roadmap was built from.
   - **Last Updated** — today's date.

3. **Do not file initiative issues, do not file a parent tracker issue, do not edit any
   other GitHub issue.** The output of this workflow is exactly one issue artifact.
   If the agent harness suggests a multi-issue tracker layout, ignore it — that pattern
   is reserved for Strategic Review and Sprint Planning.

Use a clear, evocative title and a structured, scannable body.
