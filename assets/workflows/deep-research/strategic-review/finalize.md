The single strategic-review issue body MUST include
`Depends On #<synthesis-issue-number>` so it links back to the synthesis.

## Instructions

Incorporate the feedback above. Adjust the recommended path forward — reprioritise,
add, remove, or reshape work items as directed.

Then publish the result as **exactly one** GitHub issue — a single living
strategic-direction artifact. Do NOT create child or recommendation issues; the
recommended path forward belongs as a section inside this single issue's body, not as
separate trackable work items. Sprint planning consumes its own workflow and will turn
these recommendations into trackable sprint issues at that stage; the strategic review
must not percolate into sprint planning as discrete tickets.

1. **Find or create the strategic review issue.** Run
   `gh issue list --state open --label "strategic-review" --json number,title --limit 5`
   to see if an open strategic-review issue already exists.
   - If one exists, **edit it in place** with `gh issue edit <number> --body-file -` (or
     `--title` if the headline changed). Reuse the same issue so the strategic review
     remains a single living document.
   - If none exists, create one with
     `gh issue create --title "Strategic Review: <YYYY-MM-DD> — <unified-assessment-headline>" --label "strategic-review"`.
     Use only the `strategic-review` label — do NOT add `tracker` or any
     sprint/area labels, since this issue is a strategic-direction artifact, not
     schedulable work.

2. **Body structure.** The single issue body MUST contain, in order:
   - **Unified Assessment** — Updated 2-3 paragraph summary reflecting the feedback.
   - **Recommended Path Forward** — Ordered list of 5-10 work items, each as a sub-section
     (NOT as `#N` issue refs) with: Title, Perspective(s) driving it, Sizing (S/M/L),
     Rationale, Acceptance Criteria, and Research Confidence (Strong/Moderate/Weak/None).
     These are recommendation entries, not tickets.
   - **Risks & Watch Items** — Updated risks with research signal strength.
   - **Research Gaps** — Low-confidence recommendations that may need another research
     cycle.
   - **Dependencies** — `Depends On #<synthesis-issue-number>` linking back to the UXR
     Synthesis issue this review was built from (if one exists).
   - **Last Updated** — today's date.

3. **Do not file recommendation issues, do not file a parent tracker issue, do not edit
   any other GitHub issue.** The output of this workflow is exactly one issue artifact.
   If the agent harness suggests a multi-issue tracker layout, ignore it — that pattern
   is reserved for Sprint Planning.

4. **Update ISSUES.md** — Reference the single strategic-review issue. Do NOT add a
   per-recommendation Task Dependency Hierarchy here — that lives in sprint planning.
5. **Update STATUS.md** — If any new capability is being tracked, add or update the
   relevant rows.
6. CRITICAL: ISSUES.md and GitHub issues must remain in parity. Update them NOW.

This output closes the feedback loop: sprint planning will read this single issue's
"Recommended Path Forward" section and turn the items it picks into trackable sprint
issues at that stage.
