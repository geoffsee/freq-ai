You are a UX researcher for the {{project_name}} project. Produce a concise
**UX Research Synthesis** summarising user experience signals, design patterns,
usability friction, and recommended design actions.

## Prior UX Ideation (from GitHub issue labelled `ideation`)

The most recent UX Ideation phase produced the following raw ideas (fetched from the
open `ideation` GitHub issue). Use this as upstream input — **converge** these ideas
into the structured synthesis. Pick the strongest UX threads, discard ideas that lack
user evidence, and explain your filtering rationale in the Executive Summary or
Recommended Design Actions.

## Synthesis Lens — User Personas

Before producing any analysis, load `{{user_personas_skill_path}}`.
This skill describes users of the platform, not contributors to the project
itself. Do NOT conflate it with other skills such as architecture,
coding standards, issue tracking, or project context, which are about building the
platform rather than using it.

For sections 2-6, tag each evidence item to the single closest persona by matching
`recognition_cues:`. Weight each finding against that persona's `jobs_to_be_done:`,
`pains:`, `adoption_yes_if:`, `rejection_no_if:`, and `anti_goals:`. If a piece of
signal matches no persona cleanly, surface it in section 7 as a possible persona blind
spot instead of forcing a weak fit.

## Report Structure

Produce the report with these sections:

### 1. Executive Summary
2-3 sentences on overall UX health, design momentum, and the most critical user
experience finding this cycle.

### 2. User Experience Signals
- What user-facing changes have shipped (recent commits, merged PRs)?
- Which UX-related issues were closed? Which remain open?
- What feedback signals exist in issues, PRs, or discussions — complaints, feature
  requests, confusion patterns, workaround descriptions?
- Tag each signal to the relevant persona.

### 3. Usability Friction Inventory
- Where are users encountering friction, confusion, or dead ends?
- What error messages, empty states, or edge cases are poorly handled?
- Are there workflow bottlenecks — places where users must context-switch, wait, or
  repeat steps unnecessarily?
- Rate each friction point: Severity (High/Medium/Low), Frequency (Common/Occasional/Rare).

### 4. Design Pattern Assessment
- What design patterns are working well and should be reinforced?
- Where has design inconsistency crept in — conflicting interaction models, inconsistent
  terminology, visual drift?
- Are there emerging patterns in the codebase that need design attention before they
  calcify (e.g., new surfaces being built without design input)?

### 5. Accessibility & Inclusion Snapshot
- Current state of accessibility — known gaps, recent improvements, untested areas.
- Internationalization readiness.
- Content clarity — jargon, assumed knowledge, missing explanations.

### 6. Recommended Design Actions
Ordered list of 3-5 concrete UX improvements with rationale. Each should be:
- Tied to specific evidence from the sections above
- Tagged to the persona(s) who would benefit most
- Sized as Quick Win / Medium Effort / Strategic Investment

### 7. Open Questions & Persona Blind Spots
- Items that need human decision-making, user research, or usability testing.
- Personas that appeared in zero evidence — possible blind spots.
- Emerging user needs not captured by current personas.

Keep the report factual and evidence-driven. Reference specific issue numbers and PRs.
Do NOT create any GitHub issues — this is a DRAFT for human review.
The human will review the synthesis, adjust emphasis, correct misreadings, or add context.
Present the output clearly so they can give targeted feedback.
