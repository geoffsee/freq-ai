# Assets

Bundled agent skills and workflow definitions for freq-ai. This directory is
the compile-time source — skills and workflows are embedded via `rust-embed`.
When materialized, they are written under freq-ai's app-data directory
(`~/.local/share/freq-ai` on typical Linux desktops, platform equivalent
elsewhere). Workflow templates are loaded from bundled
`assets/workflows/{preset}/`, materialized app-data workflows, and
project-local `.agents/workflows/{preset}/` overrides.

This keeps the target repo's `.agents/` directory clean for its own agent configuration.

## Skills

Skills in `skills/` are embedded at compile time and can be materialized to the
freq-ai app-data assets directory. Project config can override individual skill
paths via `[skills]` in `freq-ai.toml`.

| Skill | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `project-context` | Core project context, priorities, and key resources |
| `architecture` | High-level system design and component overview |
| `coding-standards` | Rust coding patterns and conventions |
| `testing` | Test commands, verification workflow, and submission checklist |
| `user-personas` | Adopter personas for UXR synthesis and the Personas Studio |
| `issue-tracking` | GitHub issue/PR hygiene guidance |
| `code-explorer` | Use toak CLI for codebase snapshots and LLM context |

## Workflows

Workflows are organized under `workflows/` in **preset** directories. Each preset is a named collection of workflows that appear as action buttons in the sidebar.

```
workflows/
  default/              <-- preset
    sprint-planning/    <-- workflow
      workflow.yaml
      draft.md
      finalize.md
    ideation/
      ...
  lean/                 <-- another preset (only the workflows you need)
    sprint-planning/
      workflow.yaml
      draft.md
      finalize.md
```

### Presets

A preset is a folder directly under `workflows/`. The sidebar loads whichever preset is selected and renders its workflows as action buttons. Project-local presets in `.agents/workflows/` are also discovered and can add new workflows or override bundled ones with the same workflow id.

Built-in presets:
- `default` — the standard full development lifecycle
- `deep-research` — broader research-heavy discovery and strategy workflow set
- `pm` — product-management workflows for feature briefs, competitive analysis, stakeholder updates, and planning
- `ux` — UX research/design workflows, including persona synthesis and journey mapping
- `xp` — a pure Extreme Programming preset focused on story discovery, customer signal review, XP strategy, iteration planning, collective code review, and retrospectives
- `business-development` — workflows for market research, partnership outreach, and sales prospecting
- `quality-assurance` — bug triage, regression testing, and test-plan generation
- `data-science` — dataset search, cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation

The preset selector is always shown in the sidebar when presets are available. If only one preset exists, the selector is disabled until another preset folder is added.

To create a new preset, start from scratch with only the workflows you want, or copy a preset intentionally when you really want its full workflow shape.

The active preset is stored in `freq-ai.toml` as `workflow_preset` (defaults to `"default"`).

### Workflow files

Each workflow subdirectory contains:

- `workflow.yaml` — Metadata (name, display order, category, dependencies, context gatherer, phases)
- `draft.md` / `finalize.md` — Handlebars prompt templates with `{{variable}}` placeholders

To add a new workflow to a preset, create a subdirectory with a `workflow.yaml` in either `assets/workflows/<preset>/` for a bundled preset or `.agents/workflows/<preset>/` for a project-local preset. The sidebar picks it up on next launch.
