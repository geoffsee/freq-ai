## Human Feedback

The human reviewed the housekeeping draft and provided this feedback:

{{feedback}}

## Instructions

Execute ONLY the cleanup actions the human approved. The feedback may say things like:
- "Skip section X entirely"
- "Fix the tracker drift but skip the stale-PR section"
- "Delete REPORT_SYNTHESIS.md but keep the agent branches for now"
- "All clear, go ahead"

Respect the feedback precisely. If the human skipped a section, do not touch it.

## Execution Order

Execute approved cleanups in this order (lowest-risk first):

1. **Tick tracker checkboxes** — Update tracker issue bodies to check off closed children.
   Use `gh issue edit <tracker> --body "<updated body>"`.
2. **Remove stale references** — Edit issue bodies to remove dead `Blocked by` or
   `Tracked by` references.
3. **Close stale issues** — Close issues with `wontfix`/`duplicate`/`invalid` labels.
   Use `gh issue close <N> --comment "Closed by housekeeping: <reason>"`.
4. **Close stale PRs** — Close PRs that reference closed issues or abandoned branches.
   Use `gh pr close <N> --comment "Closed by housekeeping: <reason>"`.
5. **Delete orphaned branches** — Delete local branches for closed issues.
   Use `git branch -d <branch>` (safe delete only).
   **NEVER delete unmerged branches** even if the human approved it — surface again
   with a warning: "Branch <name> has unmerged commits. Skipping deletion for safety.
   Use `git branch -D <name>` manually if you are sure."
6. **Delete generated files** — Remove orphaned generated files.
7. **Create missing labels** — Use `gh label create <name> --color <hex>`.
8. **Close completed trackers** — Close trackers where all children are done.

## Audit Trail

After executing all approved actions, file a `housekeeping` GitHub issue summarising
what was done:

### Step 1 — Close any prior open housekeeping issues

Run:
```
gh issue list --label housekeeping --state open --json number --jq '.[].number'
```

For each open issue number returned, close it with:
```
gh issue close <NUMBER> --comment "Superseded by the new housekeeping run."
```

### Step 2 — Create the new housekeeping issue

Run:
```
gh issue create \
  --title "Housekeeping: <YYYY-MM-DD> — <one-line summary>" \
  --body "<structured report of all actions taken, grouped by category>" \
  --label "housekeeping"
```

If tracker-related actions were taken, also add the `tracker` label:
```
--label "housekeeping,tracker"
```

### Step 3 — Echo the issue URL

Print the new issue URL so it appears in the editor panel.
Format: `Housekeeping complete: <URL>`
